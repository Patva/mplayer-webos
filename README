This is a fork of mplayer that is hacked for the HP Touchpad.  

The majority of the changes here are in libvo/vo_sdl.c, the changes include:
* NEON accelerated YUV to RGB conversion
* Rendering of video using openGL 2.0
* Subtitles and On Screen Display
* Basic touch screen controls (Pause/Play, FF/Rew, Subtitle Toggle)

Currently MKV playback optimization is still under scrutiny.  Thus far, the best playback options are:
-lavdopts fast:skiploopfilter=all:threads=4 -quiet
